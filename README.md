# Trust with Heterogeneous Hardware: Secure Agentic AI System Design using Heterogeneous Trusted Hardware

Agentic AI systems are rapidly proliferating within multistakeholder ecosystems where any third party may instantiate and deploy new agents across heterogeneous infrastructure. As these agents grow in autonomy and gain access to sensitive resources (e.g., payment credentials or proprietary data), to ensure trust in their results execution within hardware-enforced trusted environments will be necessary. Particularly, agents will need to authenticate each other’s state, without exposing sensitive information, to trust each other. Existing attestation schemes offer little more than coarse bearer tokens and vendor-specific protocols. This leaves agents vulnerable to data leakage, replay attacks, and placement fingerprinting. We present HetSec, a lightweight, data-centric attestation framework that embeds fine-grained access control directly into the agents’ encrypted data exchange. HetSec fuses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with multi-authority attribute-based encryption. Agents obtain role-scoped decryption keys from a federation of attribute authorities, and a secure agent–regardless of hardware vendor–implicitly proves both its platform’s integrity and policy compliance by successfully decrypting a request. This implicit attestation eliminates interactive certificate checks, conceals exact placement, supports dynamic agent churn, and enables agile, cross-architecture trust establishment. Evaluation on various TEE technologies indicates that HetSec scales to thousands of concurrent agents and reduces verification latency, all with negligible runtime overhead.
